      <div className="large">Hello, </div> my name is Megan Chavez. I am a photographer based in Conroe, Texas. If I am not behind a camera, I am happily an Aunt to my adorable niece and nephew. I love snuggling with my dog, hanging out with my friends and siblings, especially eating Chick-Fil-A with them. If you think I am a good fit for you, make sure to contact me to set up a session.
